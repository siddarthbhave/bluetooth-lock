# Bluetooth Lock powered by Arduino

## Code for Arduino board with an attached Servo motor.

This code rotates the Servo motor by an angle of 180Â° from it's initial position based on the input received. The input is user driven and takes values ```{1, 0}```.

The action of Servo motor can be coupled with any lock and hence can be used to lock and unlock.
